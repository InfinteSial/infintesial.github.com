        E1 is the second robot made by honda which is the most memoryable in the long run. It walks at a averge speed (much slower than humans) and has a very robotic walk cycle this is when honda realesed the project and told the public up untill this point honda robotics as it is, was a secret
    E1 was much bigger clocking in at 72 kg while E0 is only 16.5 kg thats a huge difference but more importantly this robot was faster even at its weight it had a massive speed boost from the last robot even after only 2 years of development, Honda was the king of robotics development at this point and it was recconized by all.
