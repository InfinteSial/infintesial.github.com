            E3 is the last (major) change that happened in the E series of robots it has a emmense history and was something unheard of at this time, its amazing that at this time they had a humanoid robot and not cell phones. This was rejoysed by everyone. it now walked not as stable as modern robots but it was manageable its walking cycle was eqaul to a remote control robot of todays age.
