			";><u>E0</u></p>

		Tokyo, Japan 1986 Honda has just made E0,

		";><u>E1</u></p>
	
		<p>A year later in the same lab E1 emerged.
			 E1 was slightly faster at 0.25 kph or 0.1553428 mph which is a huge improvement, but it still walked without any sense of its 
			environment which would make its walk cycle look more like a remote control robot.</p>
